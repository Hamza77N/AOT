    <h1>Attack on Titan</h1>
    <p>The Nine Titans  were nine Titan powers that had been passed down through the Eldian people for nearly 2,000 years after the death of Ymir Fritz until the death of Eren Yeager, with each having their own name. The nine Titan powers were the Founding Titan, the Armored Titan, the Attack Titan, the Beast Titan, the Cart Titan, the Colossus Titan, the Female Titan, the Jaw Titan and the War Hammer Titan</p>

    <ul>
       <li>The Founding Titan , by screaming, could turn Subjects of Ymir into Titans, control the minds of Titans, and alter the memories and bodies of Subjects of Ymir, but only if the inheritor had royal blood or was in contact with a Titan of royal blood. It was connected to all Subjects of Ymir and Titans via paths.</li>

       <li>The Armored Titan  was covered by hardened, armor-like skin, except in key areas necessary for movement. It also possessed the ability to harden its arms and feet into sharper claws which could be used to climb structures such as the Walls.</li>

       <li>The Attack Titan  could receive memories from both past and future inheritors of the Titan. Guided by these memories, it always moved ahead, fighting for freedom </li>

       <li>The Beast Titan  could take on the physical characteristics of different animals that vary between its inheritors.</li>

       <li>The Cart Titan  was quadrupedal and had great endurance that allowed it to stay transformed for long periods of time,as well as transform in rapid succession without needing to rest, hundreds of times per day even. Its speed rivaled that of the Jaw Titan</li>
  
       <li>The Colossus Titan  was enormous and could emit immense amounts of steam from its body like a blast furnace, at the gradual cost of its muscle tissue. The user was able to control the Titan's transformation power and blast radius </li>

       <li>The Female Titan  could inherit abilities much more easily than any of the other Titans. It could also harden areas of its skin for extra offensive and defensive capabilities. It also had the ability to summon Pure Titans with its scream.</li>

       <li>The Jaw Titan was the swiftest of the Nine Titans and had sharp, hardened teeth and claws capable of damaging or breaking almost anything</li>

       <li> The War Hammer Titan  could materialize various weapons and structures from its own hardened flesh,It could be controlled from afar through a cable of Titan flesh while the user remained hidden within a hardened crystal casing.            </li>
       </ul>
